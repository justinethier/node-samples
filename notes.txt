weather stations
can get NOAA data from: http://weather.noaa.gov/tg/site.shtml

TODO: use all.zip to generate a list of stations. filter the list by recent updates (remove ones w/last update time of 2009 for example)
      this file would be similar to station-locations.csv
      then, need to annotate this file (or create a new one) that stamps a zip code on each station
      if node a good tool for any of this?
